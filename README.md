# Flood-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model
This project includes a flood prediction model that uses a hybrid approach combining SARIMA and XGBoost. The model is designed to analyze historical flood data and predict future flood occurrences.

# ðŸ“Œ Dataset Information
-The model is trained on the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) dataset, which contains historical weather and flood occurrence data. <br>
-Data features include Rainfall, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, and other relevant meteorological variables. <br>
-The dataset is processed and resampled to monthly intervals for time series forecasting.

# ðŸ“Œ Key Features
-Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and resampling. <br>
-Time Series Forecasting: The SARIMA model is used for trend analysis. <br>
-Machine Learning Enhancement: XGBoost is trained on residuals to improve accuracy. <br>
-Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and Accuracy are calculated. <br>
-Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Flood Occurrences and Future Forecasting

# ðŸ“Š Model Output
-Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures how well the model predicts flood occurrences. <br>
-Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Evaluates overall prediction error. <br>
-Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Calculates the modelâ€™s accuracy in percentage terms. <br>
-Overall Model Accuracy: 98.17% <br>
-Graphical Representations: <br>
Actual vs Predicted flood occurrences. <br>
Future Forecast (2015-2024) to visualize flood trends for the next 10 years.
